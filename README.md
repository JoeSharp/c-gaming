# c-gaming

Experimenting with building simple games that rely on data structures and algorithms

Just trying to practice that low level programming I used to do, with memory management etc.

I will also look to rewrite all of these in Rust, but use my C programs as a reference.

The Makefile will build and run whatever state the code is in at the time

```bash
make
```
